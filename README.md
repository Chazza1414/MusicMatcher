# Music Matcher

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the Team Project module in the second year of my Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Birmingham.

MusicMatcher is a music recommendation application that analyses the user's music library and suggests songs they will like. This is presented in a style similar to a dating app, where the opinion of each song is used to improve the machine learning algorithm to enhance recommendations.

It is a web-based application with an Angular front end, Springboot backend and a PostgreSQL database, all generated using JHipster.
The project heavily relies on the Spotify API which is used to load the user library, return track information and many other things.
