Functions:
- Build user music profile
- Get next recommended song


Build User Music Profile:

We will have a list of N songs, and hence their IDs, that the user has either selected in initial training
or we have received from their imported playlists
The API request to get all a user's playlists will return the IDs of all the songs in the playlist
along with the genres associated with the songs and the artist
We will then make a Spotify API request to: https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features along with
a list of the IDs
A maximum of 100 IDs can be submitted per request, so divide the list of song IDs into separate requests
The song attributes that we will use to recommend a song are:
- Acousticness
- Danceability
- Energy
- Instrumentalness
- Loudness
- Speechiness
- Tempo
- Valence
- Genre (gathered when importing songs from a user's playlist)
Each of the above metrics will be tallied for all songs and divided by the number of songs to obtain an average
The Spotify recommendation API endpoint will be used to get X songs
Generate a list of songs from these that the user hasn't heard
This is used because there is no feature to get a list of random songs
The feature will allow us to slightly fine tune the random songs we get but will still allow for
our machine learning algorithm
Using the X songs, request detail about them using the audio-features endpoint
Using the nearest neighbour in n dimensions algorithm found here: https://github.com/Jilocasin/nearest-neighbour
Create a point for each song returned by the recommendation endpoint
Create a point for the user's preferences
Run the code for finding the nearest neighbour
Return this song to the main page
